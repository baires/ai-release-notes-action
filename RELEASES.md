4. **Click "Run workflow"**

### Option 3: Automatic on Package.json Changes

1. **Update `package.json` version**
2. **Commit and push to main branch**

## üîÑ Automated Release Workflow

The release workflow (`release.yml`) handles:

1. **Version Detection** - From manual input or package.json changes
2. **Testing** - Runs full test suite  
3. **Building** - Creates distribution files
4. **Documentation Updates** - Automatically updates all version references
5. **Version Verification** - Ensures all references are updated consistently
6. **Tagging** - Creates semantic version tags
7. **Release Creation** - Generates release notes and GitHub release
8. **Major Version Update** - Updates `v1`, `v2` tags to point to latest
9. **Marketplace Guidance** - Creates issue with publication checklist

### üìù Automatic Version Reference Updates

Every release automatically updates version references in:
- All example workflows (`examples/*.yml`)
- README.md usage examples
- RELEASES.md documentation
- Any other documentation files

**Version Update Strategy:**
- **Specific versions**: Updated to exact release version (e.g., `@v1.0.0`, `@v1.1.0`)
- **Major versions**: Updated to current major version (e.g., `@v1`, `@v2`)
- **Consistency**: All references within a file maintain the same version style

## üõ†Ô∏è Release Files

The following files are involved in the release process:

- `package.json` - Version source of truth
- `action.yml` - Action metadata
- `dist/` - Built distribution files (required for marketplace)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Manual changelog (optional)
- `scripts/release.sh` - Release automation script
- `scripts/verify-versions.sh` - Version consistency verification script
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Automated release workflow
- `.github/workflows/marketplace-publish.yml` - Marketplace validation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Tag already exists"
```bash
# Delete tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push --delete origin v1.0.0
```

### "Distribution files out of date"
```bash
# Rebuild and commit
npm run build
git add dist/
git commit -m "chore: rebuild distribution files"
```

### "Tests failing"
```bash
# Fix tests and re-run
npm test
# Or run specific test
npm test -- core.test.js
```

### "Version references inconsistent"
```bash
# Check version reference consistency
./scripts/verify-versions.sh

# Check against specific version
./scripts/verify-versions.sh v1.0.0

# Fix all version references automatically
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0
```

### "Mixed version references in documentation"
```bash
# Manually update specific files
sed -i 's|baires/ai-release-notes-action@v1[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*|baires/ai-release-notes-action@v1.0.14|g' README.md

# Or use the release script to update everything
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0
```
